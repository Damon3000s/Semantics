I can see you have compilation errors where `int` values are being passed where `IUnit` is expected. Let me examine the problematic file to understand the issue and fix it.

---

Could not find file 'C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Semantics\Semantics\Quantities\Core\PhysicalDimension.cs' in the workspace.

---

Let me read the correct file path:

---

Read file: Semantics/Quantities/Core/PhysicalDimension.cs

---

Let me read the entire file to understand the constructor and base unit logic:

---

Read file: Semantics/Quantities/Core/PhysicalDimension.cs

---

Now I can see the issue! Looking at the file, I can see the problem is in the operator overloads on lines 104, 119, and 134. The main constructor takes an `IUnit` as the first parameter, but the operator overloads for `*`, `/`, and `Pow` are calling the constructor with just the dimension values (integers) and missing the required `IUnit` parameter.

Let me fix these constructor calls by providing a proper base unit:

Perfect! I've fixed all three compilation errors in the `PhysicalDimension.cs` file. The issue was that the constructor for `PhysicalDimension` expects an `IUnit` as the first parameter, but the operator overloads were trying to create new instances without providing this required parameter.

Here's what I fixed:

1. **Line 109 (multiplication operator `*`)**: Added `left.BaseUnit` as the first parameter
2. **Line 124 (division operator `/`)**: Added `left.BaseUnit` as the first parameter  
3. **Line 139 (static `Pow` method)**: Added `dimension.BaseUnit` as the first parameter

The fixes ensure that when creating new `PhysicalDimension` instances in these operations, we properly pass the base unit from one of the input dimensions. This maintains the dimensional integrity while performing mathematical operations on physical dimensions.

The compilation errors should now be resolved!
