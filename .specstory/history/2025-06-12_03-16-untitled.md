I can see you have compilation errors where `int` values are being passed where `IUnit` is expected. Let me examine the problematic file to understand the issue and fix it.

---

Could not find file 'C:\dev\ktsu-dev\Semantics\Semantics\Quantities\Core\PhysicalDimension.cs' in the workspace.

---

Let me read the correct file path:

---

Read file: Semantics/Quantities/Core/PhysicalDimension.cs

---

Let me read the entire file to understand the constructor and base unit logic:

---

Read file: Semantics/Quantities/Core/PhysicalDimension.cs

---

Now I can see the issue! Looking at the file, I can see the problem is in the operator overloads on lines 104, 119, and 134. The main constructor takes an `IUnit` as the first parameter, but the operator overloads for `*`, `/`, and `Pow` are calling the constructor with just the dimension values (integers) and missing the required `IUnit` parameter.

Let me fix these constructor calls by providing a proper base unit:
