## 🚦 Implementation Workflow

1. **Constants First**: Identify and define all physical constants for the domain in `PhysicalConstants.cs` before implementing quantities.
2. **Quantities**: Implement each quantity as a generic, type-safe class with full XML documentation, following the established patterns.
3. **Units & Dimensions**: Define SI and common units in `Units.cs` and add/update `PhysicalDimensions.cs` as needed.
4. **Mathematical Relationships**: Implement and test key mathematical relationships between quantities.
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit tests for creation, conversion, validation, and mathematical relationships.
6. **Documentation**: Update XML docs, `docs/complete-library-guide.md`, and usage examples.
7. **Review & Refactor**: Refactor any hard-coded values, ensure code standards, and review for completeness.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Code Standards & Guidelines
- **Centralize all constants** in `PhysicalConstants.cs` with type-safe generic accessors.
- **No hard-coded values** in quantity/unit implementations.
- **Comprehensive XML documentation** for all public types and members.
- **Unit tests** for all quantities, conversions, and relationships.
- **Consistent file headers** and null safety.
- **Follow established patterns** from the Chemical domain.
- **Update documentation** as new features are added.

---

## 🔄 Review & Refactor
- [ ] Refactor any legacy code to use centralized constants.
- [ ] Review for code/documentation consistency.
- [ ] Expand integration and performance tests as domains grow.

---

## 📅 Next Actions
- [ ] Begin Mechanical domain: constants, then quantities, then tests/docs.
- [ ] Prepare for cross-domain integration and performance testing.
- [ ] Regularly update this tracker as progress is made.
