# Semantics Library Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating all functionality of the Semantics library. The examples are organized by topic for easy navigation and learning.

## Quick Start

If you're new to the Semantics library, start with [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for basic usage patterns.

## Example Categories

### Core Functionality

-   **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)** - Basic usage, type safety, and your first semantic strings
-   **[Type Conversions](type-conversions.md)** - Cross-type conversions, implicit/explicit operators, and the `.As<T>()` method
-   **[String Operations](string-operations.md)** - String compatibility, LINQ operations, and method extensions

### Validation System

-   **[Validation Attributes](validation-attributes.md)** - Built-in validation attributes and validation logic control
-   **[Advanced Validation](advanced-validation.md)** - Custom validation rules, business logic, and multi-level validation

### Specialized Features

-   **[Path Handling](path-handling.md)** - File system paths, existence validation, and path canonicalization
-   **[Factory Pattern](factory-pattern.md)** - Object creation, dependency injection, and validation strategies

### Real-World Usage

-   **[Real-World Scenarios](real-world-scenarios.md)** - Complete domain examples for e-commerce, finance, and configuration

## Library Features Covered

✅ **Type Safety** - Compile-time prevention of parameter confusion  
✅ **Validation Attributes** - Built-in and custom validation rules  
✅ **Type Conversions** - Safe cross-type conversions with validation  
✅ **String Compatibility** - Full System.String interface support  
✅ **Path Handling** - File system path types and validation  
✅ **Factory Pattern** - Clean object creation and DI integration  
✅ **Custom Canonicalization** - Automatic input normalization  
✅ **LINQ Support** - Natural collection operations  
✅ **Performance** - Span-based operations and minimal allocations  
✅ **Enterprise Integration** - ASP.NET Core and dependency injection

## Architecture Benefits

The Semantics library implements clean architecture principles:

-   **Single Responsibility** - Each type has one clear purpose
-   **Open/Closed** - Extensible validation without modifying core types
-   **Liskov Substitution** - Safe type hierarchies and conversions
-   **Interface Segregation** - Focused interfaces for specific needs
-   **Dependency Inversion** - Factory pattern for flexible object creation

## Running the Examples

All examples are complete and runnable. To use them in your project:

1. Install the Semantics library
2. Copy the relevant example code
3. Add necessary using statements
4. Adapt to your specific domain needs
